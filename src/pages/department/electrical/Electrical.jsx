            Since the discovery of electricity by scientist Volta, the journey
            of modern civilization essentially began. Life without electricity
            is stagnant and the world remains inert without Electrical
            Technology. Our agriculture-dependent and industrial-based economy
            is now fully reliant on electricity. From heavy industries to small
            cottage industries and rural agricultural tools, everything is still
            controlled by electricity. To sustain the current civilization with
            all modern tools, the entire field of Medical Science, including all
            its instruments, is powered by electricity. All tools of
            civilization are meaningless without Electrical Technology.
            Therefore, it can be said that the importance of electricity in
            civilization is unparalleled and its significance will endure
            indefinitely. As a result, the demand for Electrical Technology is
            steadily increasing.
