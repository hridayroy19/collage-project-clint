            Mechanical technology refers to machine technique. Again machinery
            means any machine or with the help of which any vehicle is operated.
            All the production oriented factories are being run with the help of
            machines. Mechanical engineering has been the holder of modern
            developments since the dawn of human civilization. A competent
            mechanical engineer is created through theoretical and practical
            classes as all the practical materials in this institution are
            sufficient in this technology. There are golden opportunities for
            self-employment and higher education along with jobs in government,
            private, autonomous institutions and various industries. Students of
            this department, located in an academic environment, develop as
            skilled engineers under the careful care of dedicated teachers.

              Mechanical engineers design power-producing machines, such as
              electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and
              gas turbines, as well as power-using machines, such as
              refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Mechanical engineers
              design other machines inside buildings, such as elevators and
              escalators. A student studying for four years Diploma in
